### Information:

*Note*: InTheLoop only sends emails from Gmail accounts, however, any email address can receive sent emails via 'SMTP_SSL 465' protocol.

- download and install locally on your machine; pip install Python and necesary packages
- use a local ENV variable to set passwords and emails via BASH for optimal security protocol
- create a path to main.py on your machine using cronjob/taskschedule for automation functionality (which already exists within the code)
- default automation set to run at 8am daily

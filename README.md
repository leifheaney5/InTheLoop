        "https://another-source.com/rss"
    ]
}
```

Or use the web interface to add feeds from the available collection.

### Changing Email Schedule

Modify the schedule line in `main.py`:

```python
# Change from 9:00 AM to your preferred time
schedule.every().day.at("06:00").do(job)  # 6 AM
```

### Adjusting Cache Duration

Update the cache timeout in the `fetch_articles` function:

```python
if age < timedelta(minutes=60):  # Change from 30 to 60 minutes
```

### Adding New Available Feeds

Edit the `available_feeds` dictionary in `main.py` to add more options to the feed browser:

```python
available_feeds = {
    "Category": [
        {"url": "https://newfeed.com/rss", "name": "New Feed Name"},
    ]

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Change the port in main.py
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
```

### Email Not Sending

- Verify your `.env` file is in the correct location
- Confirm you're using an App Password (not your regular password)
- Check that your Gmail account has "Less secure app access" enabled if needed

### Articles Not Loading
